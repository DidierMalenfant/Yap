**Aspen** is a [**Playdate**](https://play.date) **toybox** which provides an easy way to make platform games for the Playdate console.

You can add it to your **Playdate** project by installing [**toybox.py**](https://toyboxpy.io), going to your project folder in a Terminal window and typing:

```console
toybox add DidierMalenfant/Aspen
toybox update
```

Then, if your code is in the `source` folder, just import the following:

```lua
import '../toyboxes/toyboxes.lua'
```

This **toybox** depends on **Plupdate**. Make sure you [read about](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/Plupdate#changes-in-your-code) what this means for your code and its `playdate.update()` callback.

This **toybox** contains **Lua** toys for you to play with.

‼️ This **toybox** is in active development, the API can change at any time... ‼️
